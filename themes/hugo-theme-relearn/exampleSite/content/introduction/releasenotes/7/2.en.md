## 7.2.0.beta (XXXX-XX-XX) {#7-2-0}

### Change

- {{% badge style="note" title=" " %}}Change{{% /badge %}} The [`expand` shortcode](shortcodes/expand) was refactored and now internally uses the [`notice` shortcode](shortcodes/notice).

  In addition, the `notice` shortcode was improved for accessibility and comes with a [brand new parameter `groupid`](shortcodes/notice#expandable-content-area-with-groupid).

  Due to these changes, `expand` and `notice` with `style=transparent` will now generate slightly different margins.

### New

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} Support for Hugoâ€™s built-in [`details` shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#details).
